It is a really big portal with many sections and diverse content, and many of those contents and sections had to be treated in a special way and different from what the system and software used (Oracle Weblogic Portal) delivered by default. My job here was to build and make the site in HTML (some parts in HTML5), CSS and Jquery, adapting it directly from the design point of view as a strict guide. The difficulty of working with Weblogic Oracle is that HTML is very little transformable from its origin, so most of the solutions were done directly at the level of CSS and ingenuity (and in some cases Jquery).",
